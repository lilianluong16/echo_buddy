      {
        "intent": "YesIntent"
      },
      {
        "intent": "NoIntent"
      }

  Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok information and download page") to create a tunnel to your local host.
  
  Copy and paste the secure-url generated by ngrok into the Endpoint section in the Configuration tab.

  
## Usage

Say "Echo (or your chosen waitword), photo buddy" to trigger the skill. 

Say "Yes" or some variant to let the program know to take your picture or, later, to update the database with photo just taken.

Say "No" or some variant to tell the program to stop and exit or, later, not to update the database.

Use the Alexa App on your smartphone to view the picture with labeled faces!
